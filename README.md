Lynk is a minimal, login-free, cross-device file transfer mobile application built with Flutter. It allows users to select multiple files on one device and securely transfer them to another device by scanning a temporary, secure QR code. Files are encrypted on-device prior to upload, ensuring absolute privacy.

Files are uploaded directly to **Cloudflare R2** via short-lived presigned URLs, and session/transfer metadata is stored in **Redis** with strict TTL-based expiration.

## Features

* **Zero Login/Sign-up:** Open the app, pick your files, and start transferring instantly.
* **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE):** Files are encrypted on-device before uploading and decrypted only on the receiver's device, ensuring that not even the server operator or Cloudflare can read their contents.
* **Multi-File Support:** Select, preview, and remove multiple files in a single transfer.
* **Direct R2 Uploads/Downloads:** File bytes stream directly between the client and Cloudflare R2 storage without proxying through the app server.
* **Secure QR Flows:**
  1. **Sender QR Flow (Primary):** Upload files $\rightarrow$ generate QR code $\rightarrow$ scan to download.
  2. **Receiver QR Flow:** Receiver generates session QR $\rightarrow$ Sender scans $\rightarrow$ Sender uploads $\rightarrow$ Receiver downloads.
* **Byte-Weighted Progress:** Real-time upload and download progress accurately calculated using file size weights.
* **Premium UX/UI:** Designed with a sleek slate-indigo dark theme and glassmorphic card elements.

## 🛠️ Architecture & Folder Structure

The client codebase is structured following **Clean Architecture** principles grouped by **Feature** to enforce separation of concerns, testability, and scalability.

```

### Clean Architecture Rules:
1. **Domain Layer:** Independent of external frameworks, libraries, and the Data layer. It holds the pure business logic (**Entities** and **Repository contracts**).
2. **Data Layer:** Handles data retrieval and serialization. It implements repository contracts, maps raw responses to entities, and connects to remote API sources.
3. **Presentation Layer:** Manages application state via **Riverpod Notifiers** and builds responsive, beautiful user interfaces.

## Tech Stack & Dependencies

* **State Management:** `flutter_riverpod` (Simple, reactive state architecture)
* **HTTP Client:** `dio` (With custom timeouts, logs, and upload/download progress streaming)
* **File Picker:** `file_picker` (For multi-file selection)
* **QR Utilities:** `qr_flutter` (QR code generation) & `mobile_scanner` (Fast camera-based QR scanning)
* **File Opener:** `open_filex` (To open downloaded files on device)
* **Equality Helper:** `equatable` (For type-safe equality value checking without boilerplates)

## 🏁 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* Flutter SDK (version `^3.12.2` or later)
* Android SDK or Xcode (for iOS development)

### Local Configuration
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the client folder.
2. Create a `.env` file in the root of the client directory:
   ```env
   API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/api/v1
   ```
   *(Note: For Android Emulators, use `http://10.0.2.2:8000/api/v1` to point to your local machine backend).*

### Commands
* **Fetch Dependencies:**
  ```bash
  flutter pub get
  ```
* **Run Linter:**
  ```bash
  flutter analyze
  ```
* **Run Tests:**
  ```bash
  flutter test
  ```
* **Run App (Local Development):**
  ```bash
  flutter run
  ```

## Security & Performance Guidelines

* **Zero-Knowledge Encryption:** Cryptographic keys are generated on-device and shared only via the QR code. Files remain fully encrypted in transit and at rest on R2 storage.
* **Secure Keys:** Never store Cloudflare R2 bucket credentials or private secrets on the client. All upload and download URLs are presigned and short-lived.
* **Low Memory Footprint:** Files are streamed during upload (`File.openRead()`) and download instead of being loaded fully into memory.
* **Abuse Controls:** File counts, total sizes, and rates are authoritatively checked on the backend and mapped to friendly, descriptive error widgets on the client.
